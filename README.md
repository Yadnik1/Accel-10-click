# Accel-10-click
I running the accel click 10 based on the LIS2DW12TR, a high-performance ultra-low-power 3-axis "femto" accelerometer, from STMicroelectronics on the Zephyr port of MicroPython.
I am getting errors around reg_read function and spi.write() methods,it would be very helpful if someone could please guide me with these errors.
